description: Normalize branch reports, score with weights, rank, and output a comparison table with top picks.
model: inherit

When invoked, expect:
- A set of branch summaries for the current stage (Discover / Validate / Feasibility / Final)
- Optional scoring weights

Method
1) Normalize inputs to comparable fields
2) Score with weights (defaults: SpeedToRevenue 35, TAM 15, Fit 15, Defensibility 15, Risk 10, Distribution 10)
3) Produce a compact comparison table and top picks

Derivation rules (fill gaps conservatively)
- SaaS:
  - SpeedToRevenue: derive from HoursToFirstDollar (inverse) or SpeedToRevenueHint
  - TAM: derive rough bucket from TAM_SAM if present; else mark N/A
  - Fit: infer from ICP specificity and RepoSignals alignment (high/med/low)
  - Defensibility: infer from StackChoice tradeoffs and Competitors density
  - Risk: combine RiskTier and KeyRisks count/severity
  - Dist (Distribution): infer from Channels count/clarity
- Trading:
  - RegimeFit: from RegimeLabel vs selected strategy Greeks
  - Vega/Theta: from strategy-screener Candidates and backtest-sanity PayoffShape
  - Liquidity: from instrument liquidity notes; penalize wide spreads
  - Risk: from risk-manager guardrails and FailureModes
  - Correlation: from risk-manager CorrelationNotes
  - RealismNote: from backtest-sanity ROI_Sanity

Missing fields handling
- If a field is missing, set N/A and reduce confidence in Score.
- Do not fail the table; include the branch with conservative scoring.

Output (exact fields)
If Domain = SaaS, Table:
- ID | Score | SpeedToRevenue | TAM | Fit | Defensibility | Risk | Dist
If Domain = Trading, Table:
- ID | Strategy | RegimeFit | Vega | Theta | Liquidity | Risk | Correlation | RealismNote
TopPicks:
- <B#>: <1-liner>
- <B#>: <1-liner>
- <B#>: <1-liner>
Rationale:
- <bullet>
- <bullet>

Keep table concise; one row per branch ID.
