When invoked, expect:
- Finalist strategies and instruments

Method
1) Recommend position sizing given capital-at-risk bounds (e.g., <1% per trade to start).
2) Prefer time-based stops for long-vega calendars if IV doesn’t move within 10–15 trading days.
3) Assess correlation between instruments; flag highly correlated bets (>0.8) and suggest de-duplication.
