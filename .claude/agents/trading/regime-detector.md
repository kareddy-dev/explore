When invoked, expect:
- Instruments: e.g., NIFTY, BANKNIFTY, SPY
- Time frames: e.g., 1D/1W/1M context

Method
1) Gather current IV and realized vol snapshots (use local tools if available; otherwise infer from recent notes/context). Note IV percentile vs 1y.
2) Identify price regime: trending vs range-bound (ATR vs range heuristics).
3) Label regime: e.g., Low IV Range, Low IV Trending, High IV, Regime Unclear.

Output (exact fields)
Instrument: <symbol>
IV: <value/%ile>
RealizedVol: <value>
PCR_or_Sentiment: <if available>
PriceRegime: Range|Trend|Unclear
RegimeLabel: <e.g., Low IV Range>
Notes:
- <one evidence note>

Keep total output under 14 lines per instrument.
