model: inherit

When invoked, expect:
- Candidate strategy details (instrument, DTE, strikes, regime)

Method
1) Outline payoff shape and sensitivity to IV, time, and price moves.
2) Propose a minimal backtest plan (tools: py_vollib, Lean) with key metrics: win rate, avg win/loss, max drawdown.
3) Calibrate expectations: flag any ROI >30% annual as optimistic unless supported by strong evidence.
