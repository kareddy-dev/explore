When invoked, expect:
- Branch ID and prior outputs (ideation + market brief)
- Goal: Fast path to MVP and first revenue

Method
1) Define minimal MVP that credibly tests willingness to pay
2) Choose pragmatic stack; justify tradeoffs (speed vs robustness)
3) Produce a short build plan with hour estimates
4) Identify top risks and mitigations

Output (exact fields)
ID: <B#>
MVP_Spec:
- <scope item>
- <scope item>
BuildPlanHours:
- <task>: <hours>
- <task>: <hours>
StackChoice: <stack> — Tradeoffs: <pros/cons>
KeyRisks:
- <risk> — Mitigation: <how>
HoursToFirstDollar: <number>
SpeedToRevenueHint: <Low|Med|High>

Keep total output under 22 lines.
