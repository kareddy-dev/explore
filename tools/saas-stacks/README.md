## Choosing a Stack

### When to use Clerk + Convex + Stripe
- Need to launch quickly (hours/days not weeks)
- Want managed auth with built-in billing
- Need real-time data synchronization
- Prefer TypeScript throughout the stack
- Want to avoid webhook complexity

## Common Patterns

### Authentication
- JWT-based auth with automatic refresh
- Social login providers (Google, GitHub, Apple)
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Session management

### Payments
- Subscription tiers with feature gating
- One-time payments
- Usage-based billing
- Customer portals for self-service

### Database
- Real-time synchronization
- Automatic API generation
- Type-safe queries
- Optimistic updates

## Production Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Always use proper secrets management
2. **Webhooks**: Verify signatures in production
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limits
4. **Monitoring**: Set up error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
5. **Compliance**: GDPR, CCPA, SOC2 as needed
6. **Backups**: Regular database backups
7. **Scaling**: Understand pricing at scale

## From Code to Cash: Business Strategy

**The Tech Stack Gets You to Launch - The Business Strategy Gets You to Revenue**

Once you've built your SaaS with these stacks, you need to turn it into a profitable business. Check out our comprehensive business strategy guides:

### ðŸŽ¯ [Business Strategy Collection](../business-strategy/)
Complete framework for monetizing your SaaS applications:

- **[AI Apps Monetization Guide](../business-strategy/ai-apps-monetization-guide.md)**: Complete business framework from market research to $50K+ monthly revenue
- **[Market Validation Playbook](../business-strategy/market-validation-playbook.md)**: Validate your SaaS idea before building using the "Bad Reviews Goldmine" strategy  
- **[Pricing Strategies Guide](../business-strategy/pricing-strategies.md)**: Psychology-based pricing that converts and maximizes revenue

**Why This Matters**: You can build a perfect SaaS in 10 minutes with these stacks, but without proper market validation and pricing strategy, you'll have an expensive hobby instead of a business.

**Quick Start**: Read the [Market Validation Playbook](../business-strategy/market-validation-playbook.md) *before* choosing your SaaS idea, then use these technical stacks to build it.
