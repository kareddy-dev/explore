## Choosing a Stack

### When to use Clerk + Convex + Stripe
- Need to launch quickly (hours/days not weeks)
- Want managed auth with built-in billing
- Need real-time data synchronization
- Prefer TypeScript throughout the stack
- Want to avoid webhook complexity

## Common Patterns

### Authentication
- JWT-based auth with automatic refresh
- Social login providers (Google, GitHub, Apple)
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Session management

### Payments
- Subscription tiers with feature gating
- One-time payments
- Usage-based billing
- Customer portals for self-service

### Database
- Real-time synchronization
- Automatic API generation
- Type-safe queries
- Optimistic updates

## Production Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Always use proper secrets management
2. **Webhooks**: Verify signatures in production
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limits
4. **Monitoring**: Set up error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
5. **Compliance**: GDPR, CCPA, SOC2 as needed
6. **Backups**: Regular database backups
7. **Scaling**: Understand pricing at scale
