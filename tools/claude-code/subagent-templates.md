### Team Workflows

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant Main as Main Claude
    participant Agent as Subagent
    
    Dev->>Main: "Review this code for security issues"
    Main->>Agent: Delegate to security-auditor
    Agent->>Agent: Analyze code for vulnerabilities
    Agent->>Main: Return security assessment
    Main->>Dev: Present findings with recommendations
```

### Specialized Tasks

1. **Code Review**: Use `code-reviewer` for PR reviews
2. **Bug Fixing**: Use `bug-hunter` for complex debugging
3. **Performance**: Use `performance-optimizer` for optimization
4. **Documentation**: Use `technical-writer` for docs
5. **Testing**: Use `test-generator` for test creation

### Context Preservation

Benefits of subagents:
- Isolated context prevents pollution
- Specialized knowledge for better results
- Parallel task execution
- Focused tool access
- Reusable configurations

## Quick Reference

### Installation

```bash
# Create agent directory
mkdir -p .claude/agents

# Add agent configuration
cat > .claude/agents/code-reviewer.json << 'EOF'
{
  "name": "code-reviewer",
  "description": "Expert code reviewer",
  "instructions": "...",
  "tools": ["read", "grep", "glob"],
  "model": "sonnet"
}
EOF
```

### Usage

```bash
# Access agents interface
/agents

# Use specific agent
claude "Use the code-reviewer agent to review the authentication module"

# Task delegation
claude "Delegate API documentation to the api-documenter agent"
```

### Management

- Store templates in version control
- Share templates across team
